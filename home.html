    <p>I like to ride around Downtown Chicago at night on Divvy Scooters and E-Bikes a lot.</p>
    <p>I would go from Grant park all the way back to IIT for the fun of it.</p>
    <p>I would even go to the planetarium at night on Lakefront Trail to enjoy the Chicago Skyline and stars.</p>

    <p>Since my dorm room faces the lake, I would always wake up early in the mornin to view the beautiful sunrise.</p>

    <p>During finals week, me and a group of friends took a trip down to St. Louis by train.</p>
    <p>We spent a long time getting there, but we ate really good food and go to see many sights and landmarks.</p>
